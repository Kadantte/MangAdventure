## Development

<!-- We'll write proper guidelines soon. -->

To debug the app set the environment variable `MANGADV_DEBUG`
to `true`. **Don't do this in production.**

You can use Django's `runserver` command to run a development
server on `127.0.0.1:8000` (or any other address you specify).
You shouldn't use the development server during production.
